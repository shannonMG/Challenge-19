# Tech Quiz Test Suite

## Description

This project enhances a **Tech Quiz Application** built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) by adding **Cypress** tests for both component-level and end-to-end (E2E) functionality. Users can take a tech quiz, answer ten random questions, view their final score, and restart the quiz after completion.

This repository focuses on configuring and implementing Cypress tests without modifying the original app's functionality.
